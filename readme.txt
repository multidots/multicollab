This plugin serves the commenting feature like Google Docs within the Gutenberg Editor!

== Description ==

<strong>Power up your editorial workflow</strong>

In a content editorial workflow, reviewing and providing feedback should be reasonably easy parts of the process.
While external collaboration tools like Google Docs are an option, online collaboration within the WordPress dashboard isn‚Äôt well set up by default. 
Copy-pasting between Google Docs and WordPress can get frustrating and time-consuming. Also, being unable to leave direct comments on a post‚Äôs draft during the editorial process is a deal-breaker. 
So, what should WordPress-focused content teams do to improve their collaborative output?

We bring to you - <a href="https://bit.ly/3vR2maF" target="_blank">Multicollab</a>: <strong>a WordPress collaboration plugin which lets you Comment, Suggest and Collaborate - in real-time, in WordPress without switching back and forth between WordPress and other Apps. You can easily share editorial feedback directly within WordPress, including commenting, tagging, replying and much more!</strong>

The Multicollab WordPress plugin is a versatile WordPress collaboration plugin designed to streamline editorial collaboration and content feedback. It allows WordPress content creators to collaborate on articles, blog posts, and other editorial content directly within WordPress. 

Install <strong>Multicollab,</strong> and you‚Äôll instantly unlock collaboration functionality you‚Äôre familiar with from applications such as Google Docs in just a few simple clicks!

<strong>Multicollab inserts real-time collaborative tools to transform editorial workflows.</strong>

This plugin adds inline commenting functionality to Gutenberg directly, making commenting a single click of a button away. Users can add comments on text as well as Media.

><em>This an easy-to-use plugin‚Äîthe best one I‚Äôm aware of‚Äîfor those who have an editorial process. My wife is a blogger and I‚Äôm her editor. We‚Äôve only begun taking advantage of it but I wanted to offer a positive shout out.
<strong>-       Mario T. Lanza - Sr. Web Developer<strong></em>

<strong>Content collaboration in Gutenberg made simple</strong>

Whether your editorial workflow consists of just two people or fifty, gathering feedback and recommending changes to WordPress content has always meant you need to take that content elsewhere, such as Google Docs or any other editing suite.

This complicates your way of work unnecessarily, makes collaboration difficult, and can even lead to severe errors going live because things fall through the cracks between applications. 

It‚Äôs also inefficient and wastes a lot of your editorial time!

<strong>Multicollab</strong> solves it once and for all.

Offering a seamless editorial workflow for teams, Multicollab is one of the best editorial collaboration tools in WordPress.  With a robust content collaboration feature set, including collaborative editing, approval workflows, and content publishing workflows, the Multicollab plugin ensures a smooth and organized content creation process.

Installing the plugin enables the following key editorial features instantly:

<ol>
<li><strong>Inline Commenting - </strong>Users can add comments on text and Media blocks to mark their feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Team Collaboration - </strong>Invite editorial users to collaborate and comment by mentioning them, ensuring quick email notifications and seamless engagement in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time Co-Editing - </strong>Collaborate with multiple users simultaneously and edit posts together in real-time.</li>
<li><strong>Guest Collaboration - </strong>Invite guest collaborators over email with magic links without creating a WordPress user account.</li>
<li><strong>Reports and Activities - </strong>Track progress across all pages and posts with easy filtering to view by user, content categories, and time stamps.</li>
<li><strong>Email Notifications - </strong>Instant email notifications make collaborations with your team easier and foster intra-group connectivity.</li>
</ol>

Multicollab offers a comprehensive editorial content management system, enabling users to oversee content production and ensure high-quality output. Whether you're seeking a WordPress workflow plugin or a team collaboration plugin in WordPress, Multicollab provides the tools needed to enhance productivity and streamline the content creation process.

üì£ <a href="https://youtu.be/s1v5_z4gGf8"><strong>Collaborate even more effectively with Premium</strong></a>

The free version of Multicollab is easy to use and gives you all the commenting functionality to power up your editorial collaboration.

Here‚Äôs what you can unlock by <a href="https://www.multicollab.com/pricing/" target="_blank">upgrading today</a>:

üëâüèª <strong>Track changes with Suggestion mode</strong>

Sometimes, a comment isn‚Äôt quite enough, and it‚Äôs best to suggest the rewording of a sentence or phrase directly. 

Like Google Docs, the plugin‚Äôs <a href="https://www.multicollab.com/features/#Suggestion-Mode">Suggestion</a> mode enabled on Multicollab Premium lets you add edits directly as suggestions to the content to enable the author or other user to accept, reject or collaborate in more detail. 
Paired with mentions, tagging and notifications, this makes collaborative editing within WordPress a breeze!

( *Suggestion mode works on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H0uksGbTMOy7f9fkSGXvkl1fwqO7ekShjo1j3JsOA6k/edit#gid=623920799">these blocks</a>.)

üëâüèª <strong>Slack Notifications</strong>

If you and your team use Slack to communicate internally, you can receive important Multicollab notifications in the Slack channel of your choice. You will get real-time updates for mentions, replies, and other comment activities in your Slack channel. 
This allows you to fit Multicollab in a place you know your team will check all day.

üëâüèª <strong> Custom Permissions </strong>

You can decide which team members should have permission to manage comments and suggestions in Multicollab. 

Settings can be configured to decide who should have access to add a comment, resolve comments, and disable comments. You can configure who should have access to accept or reject suggestions.


üëâüèª <strong>Add Attachments to Comments</strong>

If a picture is worth a thousand words, isn't a video worth a thousand pictures?

The Attach Document feature allows you to share additional references and context to your comment. Collaborators can attach images or documents to their comments and replies. It opens up the possibility for you to express your thoughts with screenshots, screencasts, audio messages, etc.


üëâüèª <strong>Multilingual</strong>

With this feature, you can use the Multicollab plugin in 6 distinct languages ‚Äì German, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, French, and Bengali.

Everything from comment boards to settings will automatically sync with your selected language so that you can enjoy streamlined collaboration no matter what language is native to you.

><em>Great Solution. Fantastic Support! We were using the free version and it was already very helpful. We were very interested in the new features but concerned about price and the complexity of our specific needs. After upgrading we worked with support to customize the plugin so we can successfully support 50 contributors that use WordPress as our core editorial management system. I fully expect it to transform our editorial process. We‚Äôre very happy with the product and the company‚Äôs support.
